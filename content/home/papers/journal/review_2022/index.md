abstract: In recent years, myoelectric control systems have emerged for upper limb wearable robotic exoskeletons to provide movement assistance and/or to restore motor functions in people with motor disabilities and to augment human performance in able-bodied individuals. In myoelectric control, electromyographic (EMG) signals from muscles are utilized to implement control strategies in exoskeletons and exosuits, improving adaptability and human–robot interactions during various motion tasks. This paper reviews the state-of-the-art myoelectric control systems designed for upper-limb wearable robotic exoskeletons and exosuits, and highlights the key focus areas for future research directions. Here, different modalities of existing myoelectric control systems were described in detail, and their advantages and disadvantages were summarized. Furthermore, key design aspects (i.e., supported degrees of freedom, portability, and intended application scenario) and the type of experiments conducted to validate the efficacy of the proposed myoelectric controllers were also discussed. Finally, the challenges and limitations of current myoelectric control systems were analyzed, and future research directions were suggested.
