  abstract  = "Early and accurate detection of scalp hair loss is imperative to
               provide timely and effective treatment plans to halt further
               progression and save medical costs. Many techniques have been
               developed leveraging deep learning to automate the hair loss
               detection process. However, the accuracy and robustness of
               assessing hair loss severity still remain a challenge and barrier
               for transitioning such a technique into practice. The presented
               work proposes an efficient and accurate algorithm to classify
               hair follicles and estimate hair loss severity, which was
               implemented and validated using a multitask deep learning method
               via a Mask R-CNN framework. A microscopic image of the scalp was
               resized, augmented, then processed through pre-trained ResNet
               models for feature extraction. The key features considered in
               this study concerning hair loss severity include the number of
               hair follicles, the thickness of the hair, and the number of
               hairs in each hair follicle. Based on these key features,
               labeling of hair follicles (healthy, normal, and severe) were
               performed on the images collected from 10 men in varying stages
               of hair loss. More specifically, Mask R-CNN was applied for
               instance segmentation of the hair follicle region and to classify
               the hair follicle state into three categories, following the
               labeling convention (healthy, normal and severe). Based on the
               state of each hair follicle captured from a single image, an
               estimation of hair loss severity was determined for that
               particular region of the scalp, namely local hair loss severity
               index (P), and by combining P of multiple images taken and
               processed from different parts of the scalp, we constructed the
               hair loss severity estimation (Pavg) and visualized in a heatmap
               to illustrate the overall hair loss type and condition. The
               proposed hair follicle classification and hair loss severity
               estimation using Mask R-CNN demonstrated a more efficient and
               accurate algorithm compared to other methods previously used,
               enhancing the classification accuracy by 4 to 15\%. This
               performance supports its potential for use in clinical settings
               to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of current hair loss
               diagnosis and prognosis techniques.",

               and alternative method to achieve muscle strength improvement. It

               improve muscle strength via an accessible and portable device.
               Twelve untrained healthy male adults (22.08 ± 4.1 years old)
               participated in an 8-week long resistance training using VARS to

               femoris, rectus femoris) of their non-dominant arm and leg using
