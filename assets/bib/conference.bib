               bilateral 6-DOF Cable-driven Upper Body Exosuit (CUBE) is
               presented in this work, designed to aid bimanual tasks via Bowden

               torso to the cuffs on the upper and lower arms. Inertial

               of convolution neural network models (CNN), one-dimensional (1D
               CNN), or three-dimensional (3D CNN) convolutional layers to
               decode the neural drive to muscles from highdensity surface
               electromyography (HD-sEMG) signals. However, the impact of the
               dimensionality (1D or 3D) of the convolutional layers on the
               performance of the deep CNN models using the same dataset has yet
               to be investigated. This study assesses the performance of 3D
               CNNs and 1D CNNs in extracting the neural drive as a cumulative
               spike train (CST) under various window sizes and step sizes that
               are critical parameters in decoding neural drives. Experimental
               HD-sEMG dataset sourced from the gastrocnemius medialis muscle of
               three participants, alongside the corresponding neural drive
               decoded using the convolution kernel compensation (CKC)
               algorithm, was employed to train and validate the 1D and 3D CNN
               models. We compared the F1 score and correlation coefficient
               between the CST from CKC and those from both 1D and 3D CNN
               models, revealing that 1D CNN performs more effectively with
               larger sliding window sizes (80 or 120 samples) with a peak F1
               score of 0.84 and a correlation of 0.94. In contrast, 3D CNN
               achieves peak F1 score (0.83) and correlation (0.92) with smaller
               sliding window sizes (20 or 40 samples), indicating reduced
               latency in using 3D CNN to decode neural drives. Both models
               experience a performance decline as the step size increases.
               Furthermore, this research evaluates the computational cost of 1D
               and 3D CNN models, finding that the 3D CNN model requires
               significantly more computational resources (938G FLOPs) than the
               1D CNN model (60G FLOPs). The results elucidate significant
               distinctions between CNN architectures and identify optimal
               parameters and model selection for precise and real-time neural
